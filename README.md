# CurrencyReport

This project is the desktop version of the Python script. User can download the currency data from the API NBP. It shows the table of the current rate of all currencies and
can download rates for single currency in the specified period of time. It presents this "special data" as a table view and could also draw a chart. Moreover I add a search option
to look for a single rate from whole period of time.
Project is written in Polish, because all currency names are in Polish.
